## Note
* In order to set the google authentication up, you must register your app @ [https://console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com) & set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` as environmental variables
* In development mode (i.e. `npm run dev`), OAuth google callback is not being proxied to the google servers. Therefore in order to test the google OAuth on your local machine do the following:
1) `npm run build`
2) `npm run prod`
